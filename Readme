1. Introduction
This is a python interface of OpenDaylight Northband REST API. It contains most of APIs except OpenStack's OpenDaylight management APIs.

2. Dependcies
This software uses requests for HTTP connection. It uses tabulate for printing the report of the API tests in an orderly fashion.
You can install it using pip tools just like:
pip install requests
pip install tabulate

3. Usage
test_api.py is a sample of how to use this software.
Use it as follows :
./test_api.py [-u <username>] [-p <password>] [-d <OpenDaylight Server URL>] [-P <port number>] [-s <Secure port number>]

4. Bugs and Problems
This software still needs much test.

5. To Do
- Make the code compliant with PEP8 coding guidelines
- Restructuring the code : Pythonize it :)
- Need to create API versions, so that when OpenDaylight moves from v2, v3 the migration is smooth
- High-level APIs based on REST APIs is under development : Need to add support of all the APIs
- OpenStack's OpenDaylight management will be added soon.
